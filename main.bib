  abstract = {Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) can be regarded as generalpurpose PDE solvers, but it might be slow to train PINNs on particular problems, and there is no theoretical guarantee of corresponding error bounds. In this manuscript, we propose a variant called Prior Dictionary based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PD-PINNs). Equipped with taskdependent dictionaries, PD-PINNs enjoy enhanced representation power on the tasks, which helps to capture features provided by dictionaries so that the proposed neural networks can achieve faster convergence in the process of training. In various numerical simulations, compared with existing PINN methods, combining prior dictionaries can significantly enhance convergence speed. In terms of theory, we obtain the error bounds applicable to PINNs and PD-PINNs for solving elliptic partial differential equations of second order. It is proved that under certain mild conditions, the prediction error made by neural networks can be bounded by expected loss of PDEs and boundary conditions.},

  title    = {A-PINN: Auxiliary physics informed neural networks for forward and inverse problems of nonlinear integro-differential equations},
  year     = {4000},
  abstract = {Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) are a novel deep learning paradigm primed for solving forward and inverse problems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). By embedding physical information delineated by PDEs in feedforward neural networks, PINNs are trained as surrogate models for approximate solution to the PDEs without need of label data. Due to the excellent capability of neural networks in describing complex relationships, a variety of PINN-based methods have bene developed to solve different kinds of problems such as integer-order PDEs, fractional PDEs, stochastic PDEs and integrodifferential equations (IDEs). However, for the state-of-the-art PINN methods in application to IDEs, integral discretization is a key prerequisite in order that IDEs can be transformed into ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, integral discretization inevitably introduces discretization error and truncation error to the solution. In this study, we propose an auxiliary physics informed neural network (A-PINN) framework for solving forward and inverse problems of nonlinear IDEs. By defining auxiliary output variable(s) to represent the integral(s) in the governing equation and employing automatic differentiation of the auxiliary output to replace integral operator, the proposed A-PINN bypasses the limitation of integral discretization. Distinct from the neural network in the original PINN which only approximates the variables in the governing equation, in the proposed A-PINN framework, a multi-output neural network is constructed to simultaneously calculate the primary outputs and auxiliary outputs which respectively approximate the variables and integrals in the governing equation. Subsequently, the relationship between the primary outputs and auxiliary outputs is constrained by new output conditions in compliance with physical laws. By pursuing the first-order nonlinear Volterra IDE benchmark problem, we validate that the proposed A-PINN can obtain more accurate solution than the conventional PINN. We further demonstrate the good performance of A-PINN in solving the forward problems involving nonlinear Volterra IDE Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4000235 2 systems, nonlinear 2-dimensional Volterra IDE, and nonlinear Fredholm IDE. Finally, the A-PINN framework is implemented to solve the inverse problem of nonlinear IDEs and the results show that the unknown parameters can be satisfactorily discovered even with heavily noisy data.},
